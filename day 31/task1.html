    <h2> what is an API</h2>
    <p>
        An <strong>API (Application Programming interface)</strong> is a way for different
        software Applicationto communicate with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        In simple words, an API acts like a <strong>bridge</strong>or <srong>messenger</srong>
        between two programs. One prgram sends a request, and the API delivers it to another
        program, then brings back the response.
